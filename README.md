# todo-app
The best to do app ever.  Period.  https://agile-dawn-39755.herokuapp.com/

## 1. Technologies Used
- MongoDB
- Express
- AngularJS
- Node.js
- Mongoose
- Passport
- ui-router
- Heroku

## 2. My Approach

## 3. Unsolved Problems
- When a user edits a toDo, the start date and due date do not autopopulate in
the edit form.
- When a user clicks on the `login` tab on the home page, the `email` field
should take focus.
- A user can enter a due date that is before the start date.

## 4. Future features
- Make the UI much better-looking.
- Dim the background when a user is creating a new toDo.
- Fix the signup/login form display on mobile.
- Add ability for user to mark a toDo as complete.
- Display all toDos in a materialize data table instead of cards.  Each row will
expand when the user clicks on that row, revealing more info about the toDo.
- Add ability for user to search through all of their toDos.
- Add ability for user to change the sort order of their toDos.
- On larger screens, display incomplete toDos in a table on the left, and
complete toDos in another table on the right.  On smaller screens, allow user to
toggle views between complete and incomplete.


## 5. User Stories
- As an unregistered user I want to:
  - register so I can log in.
  - log in so I can use the app.
- As a logged in user I want to:
  - Create a new to do so I can organize my life.
  - Edit a to do so I can fix mistakes.
  - Mark a to do as 'complete' so I can track my progress.
  - Delete a to do so I no longer track its progress.
  - View all of my to dos so I can decide what to do next.
  - Change the sort order of my to dos (created, updated, start date, due date)
  so I can decide what to do next.
  - Search for to dos with a search bar so I can find the one(s) I'm interested
  in.
